# OpenSteamworks
Interact with Steam's client interfaces. You'll need to provide your own binaries, versioned exactly the same as `Manifests/<platform manifest>`
Note that this library cannot check the version, instead various issues will manifest at runtime like segfaults, wrong functions being called, issues connecting to existing clients, etc.
